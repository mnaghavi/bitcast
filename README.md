- 🔵 Fair: 50-60% (Better than random but moderate accuracy)
- 🟡 Poor: 40-50% (Below random, needs improvement)
- 🔴 Very Poor: <40% (Poor performance)

**Price Accuracy**: Predictions within X% of actual price
- **Within 5%**: Very precise predictions
- **Within 10%**: Acceptable range for trading decisions

**MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Lower values indicate better accuracy
- <5%: Excellent precision
- 5-10%: Good precision
- 10-20%: Fair precision
- >20%: Poor precision

### Typical Performance Results
